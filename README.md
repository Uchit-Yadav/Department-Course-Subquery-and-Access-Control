ðŸ“˜ Department-Course Management System (SQL, 3NF)
This project showcases the design and implementation of a simple academic database system using SQL, normalized up to Third Normal Form (3NF). It involves creating and managing departments and their courses, inserting sample data, querying using subqueries, and applying access control using DCL.

ðŸ§© Project Parts

ðŸ“Œ Part A: Table Creation with 3NF Normalization
Objective:
Design two normalized tables: Departments and Courses.

ðŸ“Œ Part B: Insert Sample Data
Objective:
Insert realistic data into both tables to simulate an academic environment.

ðŸ“Œ Part C: Query with Subquery
Objective:
Use a subquery to find departments offering more than two courses.

ðŸ“Œ Part D: Grant SELECT Permission (DCL)
Objective:
Restrict data access to a user named viewer_user with only read access to the Courses table.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL-compatible),
DDL (CREATE, DROP),
DML (INSERT),
DQL (SELECT with subquery),
DCL (GRANT)
